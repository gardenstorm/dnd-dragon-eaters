			<h3>Who made this site?</h3>
			<p>Erika Nieves, who plays Darona in our campaign. AKA the best character. üòé </p>
			<h3>Why? Facebook and other resources exist.</h3>
			<p>We do use Messenger to communicate with each other. Things get lost in there though, and not all of us have or use Facebook. So, I decided to create a centraized place for information on our campaign. Plus, I'm an aspiring frontend developer, so this is a fun project. ‚ò∫Ô∏è</p>
			<h3>How'd you make this site?</h3>
			<p>I used the horizontal accordion code from this site and made it work with flexbox.</p>
