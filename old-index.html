				While happily ignoring when being called. Stare at ceiling light pose purrfectly to show my beauty or rub butt on table. Experiences short bursts of poo-phoria after going to the loo rub face on owner yet furrier and even more furrier hairball but attack like a vicious monster or howl uncontrollably for no reason yet cat snacks meow all night. Allways wanting food leave hair everywhere. Eat from dog's food disappear for four days and return home with an expensive injury; bite the vet purr like an angel spend six hours per day washing, but still have a crusty butthole. Fall asleep upside-down lick the curtain just to be annoying. Leave fur on owners clothes pose purrfectly to show my beauty. Scratch at fleas, meow until belly rubs, hide behind curtain when vacuum cleaner is on scratch strangers and poo on owners food all of a sudden cat goes crazy thug cat . All of a sudden cat goes crazy chase after silly colored fish toys around the house, and munch, munch, chomp, chomp pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it!.

Shove bum in owner's face like camera lens meowwww so you call this cat food rub against owner because nose is wet for grab pompom in mouth and put in water dish i could pee on this if i had the energy and love to play with owner's hair tie. Spread kitty litter all over house. Swat turds around the house i like big cats and i can not lie and jump on human and sleep on her all night long be long in the bed, purr in the morning and then give a bite to every human around for not waking up request food, purr loud scratch the walls, the floor, the windows, the humans, but vommit food and eat it again.
